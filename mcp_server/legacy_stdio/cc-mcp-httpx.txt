> # Overview of the MCP Server Authentication Issue

  ## Core Problem

  The `authenticate_user` tool, running within a Python-based Model Context 
  Protocol (MCP) server, consistently fails to authenticate with the Convex 
  backend. The server returns a misleading error: `Could not find public 
  function for 'signIn'`, even though the correct function path is 
  `auth:signIn`.

  ## Key Findings

  A thorough investigation revealed a paradoxical situation:

  1.  **Standalone Success:** The `convex-py` library, when used in a simple 
  standalone Python script (`test_convex_login.py`), successfully authenticates
   with the Convex backend using the `auth:signIn` action. This proves that the
   Convex deployment, user credentials, and the `convex-py` library itself are 
  all functioning correctly in isolation.

  2.  **MCP Environment Failure:** The error only occurs when the *exact same 
  authentication logic* is executed from within the `mcp.server` environment. 
  This points to a subtle, low-level conflict between the MCP server's 
  asynchronous event loop and the networking libraries used to communicate with
   Convex.

  ## Debugging and Mitigation Attempts

  Multiple approaches were taken to resolve the issue from within the MCP 
  server, none of which succeeded:

  *   **Correcting the Function Call:** Ensured the code explicitly calls the 
  namespaced `auth:signIn` as an `action`, not a `mutation`.
  *   **Isolating Client State:** Refactored the code to create a fresh 
  `ConvexClient` instance for every request to prevent potential state 
  corruption.
  *   **Bypassing the WebSocket Client:** Replaced the `convex-py` library's 
  client with direct HTTP POST requests to the Convex API's 
  `/api/actions/auth:signIn` endpoint using the `requests` library.
  *   **Verifying the HTTP Router:** Confirmed the Convex backend's HTTP router
   (`convex/http.ts`) was correctly configured to handle authentication routes.

  Despite these exhaustive efforts, the Convex backend consistently behaves as 
  if the `auth:` namespace is being stripped from the function path, but only 
  when the request originates from the `mcp.server` environment.

  ## Conclusion

  The root cause is a low-level incompatibility between the `mcp.server`'s 
  async environment and the underlying networking libraries (`convex-py`'s 
  WebSocket or Python's `requests`). The next recommended step is to report 
  this issue to the maintainers of the respective libraries, as the problem 
  lies within their internal workings and cannot be resolved from the 
  application level.

  Here is the second opinion Below:
  """
  Based on my research on MCP (Model Context Protocol) transports and the 
  specific authentication issues described in your conversation history, I can 
  provide you with a comprehensive analysis of whether switching to streamable 
  HTTP transport might help resolve your authentication problem.

  # Streamable HTTP Transport as a Solution for MCP Authentication Issues

  ## Understanding the Core Problem

  Based on your conversation history, the authentication issue you're 
  experiencing appears to be a **complex interaction between the MCP server's 
  event loop and the Convex authentication system**. The key evidence 
  supporting this is:

  1. **Your standalone test script works perfectly** - This proves that 
  convex-py, your credentials, and the Convex backend are all functioning 
  correctly
  2. **Both convex-py WebSocket calls and direct HTTP requests fail within the 
  MCP server** - This suggests the issue is with the MCP server runtime 
  environment itself
  3. **The error persists regardless of implementation approach** - Even when 
  using identical code that works standalone

  ## How Streamable HTTP Transport Could Help

  ### 1. **Simplified Network Architecture**

  Streamable HTTP transport offers several advantages over stdio transport that
   could resolve your authentication conflicts:

  **Single HTTP Endpoint**: Unlike stdio transport which relies on process 
  communication, streamable HTTP uses a single HTTP endpoint (`/mcp`) for all 
  communication[1]. This eliminates the complex process management that may be 
  interfering with your networking calls.

  **Stateless Request Handling**: Each JSON-RPC message is sent as a separate 
  HTTP POST request[2]. This means each authentication attempt would be 
  completely isolated from the MCP server's event loop, potentially avoiding 
  the async conflicts you're experiencing.

  ### 2. **Event Loop Isolation**

  The research reveals that **event loop conflicts are a common issue with MCP 
  servers**[3][4]. Streamable HTTP transport could resolve this by:

  - **Separate Process Model**: Your MCP server would run as an independent 
  HTTP service, completely separate from the client's event loop
  - **Standard HTTP Networking**: Uses established HTTP libraries and patterns 
  that are less likely to conflict with asyncio event loops
  - **Better Connection Management**: HTTP connections are managed by the web 
  server framework, not the MCP server directly

  ### 3. **Network Transport Benefits**

  **Proven Reliability**: Multiple sources indicate that streamable HTTP 
  transport is more robust for network operations[5][6]. The research shows:

  - Better handling of connection interruptions
  - Support for resumable connections
  - More predictable behavior with external API calls

  **Reduced Complexity**: Unlike stdio transport which requires complex process
   management, HTTP transport follows standard web patterns[7]:

  ```python
  # Instead of complex subprocess management
  # Your server would be a simple HTTP service
  app = FastAPI()

  @app.post("/mcp")
  async def handle_mcp_request(request: Request):
      # Authentication calls happen in standard HTTP context
      # No event loop conflicts with MCP process management
      return await process_mcp_request(request)
  ```

  ## Implementation Considerations

  ### 1. **Modern Framework Support**

  The research shows that **modern MCP frameworks like FastMCP specifically 
  support streamable HTTP transport**[8][9]:

  ```python
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP("cyan-science-journal")

  # Your authentication tools would work in HTTP context
  @mcp.tool()
  async def authenticate_user(email: str, password: str):
      # This runs in standard HTTP server context
      # No MCP stdio event loop interference
      client = ConvexClient(convex_url)
      result = await client.action("auth:signIn", {"email": email, "password": 
  password})
      return result

  # Run with HTTP transport
  mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
  ```

  ### 2. **Configuration Changes Required**

  You would need to update your MCP client configuration from:

  ```json
  {
    "command": "/path/to/python",
    "args": ["server.py"],
    "transport": "stdio"
  }
  ```

  To:

  ```json
  {
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
    "transport": "streamable-http"
  }
  ```

  ### 3. **Networking Advantages**

  **Better Authentication Handling**: HTTP transport is designed for 
  authentication scenarios[10]. You could:

  - Use standard HTTP authentication headers
  - Implement OAuth flows more easily
  - Handle authentication errors with standard HTTP status codes

  **Firewall and Proxy Friendly**: HTTP transport works better in corporate 
  environments and with load balancers[11][12].

  ## Potential Drawbacks to Consider

  ### 1. **Increased Complexity**

  - **Deployment**: You'll need to manage the HTTP server lifecycle
  - **Security**: HTTP endpoints need proper security configuration
  - **Dependencies**: May require additional dependencies for HTTP server 
  framework

  ### 2. **Performance Considerations**

  - **Latency**: HTTP transport has higher latency than stdio due to network 
  overhead[6]
  - **Resource Usage**: HTTP servers consume more resources than stdio 
  processes

  ### 3. **Development Workflow**

  - **Testing**: You'll need to start/stop the HTTP server for testing
  - **Debugging**: HTTP transport may be more complex to debug than stdio

  ## Recommendation

  **Yes, switching to streamable HTTP transport is likely to resolve your 
  authentication issues** for the following reasons:

  1. **Event Loop Isolation**: Your authentication logic would run in a 
  standard HTTP server context, completely separate from MCP's process 
  management
  2. **Proven Network Reliability**: HTTP transport is specifically designed 
  for network operations and external API calls
  3. **Modern Standard**: Streamable HTTP is the current recommended transport 
  for MCP[1][2]
  4. **Better Error Handling**: HTTP status codes and headers provide clearer 
  error reporting

  ## Implementation Strategy

  1. **Start with FastMCP**: Use the modern FastMCP framework which has 
  built-in streamable HTTP support
  2. **Preserve Your Authentication Logic**: Your existing authentication code 
  should work without modification in HTTP context
  3. **Test Incrementally**: Start with a simple HTTP server to verify 
  authentication works, then add MCP functionality
  4. **Monitor Performance**: Compare response times and resource usage with 
  your stdio implementation

  The evidence strongly suggests that the stdio transport's process management 
  and event loop handling are the root cause of your authentication failures. 
  Streamable HTTP transport would eliminate these issues by providing a clean, 
  isolated HTTP server environment for your authentication operations.
  """
  Claude, what do you think we should do?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is presenting a complex technical issue involving an MCP (Model 
  Context Protocol) server authentication problem and asking for my opinion on 
  what they should do. Let me analyze the situation:

  The core problem is that authentication with a Convex backend works fine in a
   standalone Python script but fails when run from within an MCP server 
  environment. The error suggests the function path auth:signIn is being 
  stripped to just signIn, but only in the MCP context.

  Two potential solutions are presented:
  1. The first analysis concludes it's a low-level incompatibility and suggests
   reporting to library maintainers
  2. The second analysis suggests switching from stdio transport to streamable 
  HTTP transport

  Let me consider both options:

  Switching to Streamable HTTP Transport:
  - Pros: Would isolate the authentication logic from MCP's event loop, uses 
  standard HTTP patterns, modern approach
  - Cons: More complexity, higher latency, need to manage HTTP server

  Reporting to Library Maintainers:
  - Pros: Could get root cause fixed
  - Cons: Uncertain timeline, may not be prioritized

  Based on the evidence presented, the streamable HTTP transport approach seems
   more promising because:
  1. The issue is clearly related to event loop conflicts in the stdio 
  transport
  2. HTTP transport would completely isolate the networking concerns
  3. It's a proven approach that's recommended for modern MCP implementations
  4. The user needs a working solution now, not potentially months from now

  I should be concise and direct as per my instructions.

● Based on the analysis, I recommend switching to streamable HTTP transport.
  Here's why:

  The evidence clearly points to event loop conflicts between MCP's stdio
  transport and your Convex authentication calls. Since your standalone script
  works perfectly, the issue is definitively the MCP runtime environment.

  Quick action plan:

  1. Use FastMCP with HTTP transport - it has built-in support and will isolate
   your auth logic from MCP's process management
  2. Keep your existing authentication code - it should work unchanged in HTTP
  context
  3. Test incrementally - start with basic HTTP server, then add MCP
  functionality

  This approach gives you:
  - Immediate solution (versus waiting for library maintainer fixes)
  - Event loop isolation that directly addresses your core problem
  - Modern, supported transport method

  The HTTP overhead is minimal compared to having a non-functional
  authentication system. Start with FastMCP and see if the authentication works
   in HTTP context - if it does, you've confirmed the root cause and have a
  working solution.

> Let's make a detailed implementation plan, and include documentation and 
  clean up please.

  transport. First, let me check if there are any existing MCP client
  configurations:

● Search(pattern: "**/*config*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "**/*.json")

  requires a proper session management. Let me check how FastMCP handles
  sessions by looking at its documentation or trying a proper MCP client
  instead of my simple test.
