# Phase 1 Environment Configuration - Verification Checklist

## ✅ Environment Security Validation

### JWT Secret Validation
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is properly generated (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] JWT_SECRET matches between .env and auth configuration
- [ ] Token expiration (SESSION_TIMEOUT=86400) is appropriate

### API Token Security
- [ ] MCP_API_TOKEN is generated and secure
- [ ] API token matches between server and client configuration
- [ ] Token is properly validated in security middleware

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- [ ] RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100 is appropriate for journal usage
- [ ] RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60000ms provides reasonable throttling
- [ ] Rate limiting is active and functioning

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] CORS_ORIGINS includes all required development/production URLs
- [ ] CORS_METHODS includes all necessary HTTP methods
- [ ] CORS_HEADERS includes authentication and content headers

## ✅ HTTP Server Startup Verification

### Port Configuration
- [ ] MCP_SERVER_PORT=3001 is available and not in use
- [ ] MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 allows external connections
- [ ] Server binds successfully to configured port

### Service Availability
- [ ] HTTP endpoint responds at http://localhost:3001/mcp/
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Server responds to HTTP requests within timeout

### Network Accessibility
- [ ] Server accessible from localhost
- [ ] Server accessible from LAN (if required)
- [ ] Server accessible via Tailscale IP (100.117.176.95)

## ✅ Authentication Integration Test

### Convex Connection
- [ ] CONVEX_URL points to correct deployment
- [ ] Convex backend is accessible and responding
- [ ] Authentication calls complete without event loop conflicts

### User Authentication Flow
- [ ] User can authenticate with email/password
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated correctly
- [ ] Tokens are properly validated on subsequent requests
- [ ] Session timeout works as expected

### Role-Based Permissions
- [ ] Author permissions validated correctly
- [ ] Reviewer permissions validated correctly
- [ ] Editor permissions validated correctly
- [ ] Permission checks prevent unauthorized access

## ✅ Client Configuration Finalization

### MCP Client Setup
- [ ] mcp_client_config.json uses correct URL
- [ ] Transport type is "streamable-http"
- [ ] Timeout is appropriate (30000ms)
- [ ] Headers include proper Accept values

### Development Scripts
- [ ] Startup script created (start_server.sh)
- [ ] Health check script created (health_check.sh)
- [ ] Environment validation script created (validate_env.sh)

## ✅ Security Hardening

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] SSL certificates configured for production
- [ ] HTTPS endpoint ready (port 443)
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration follows security best practices

### Reverse Proxy Setup
- [ ] Nginx configured as reverse proxy
- [ ] Rate limiting applied at proxy level
- [ ] SSL termination configured

### Firewall Configuration
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict unnecessary ports
- [ ] Port 3001 access controlled appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

## 🎯 Final Verification Commands

### Test Server Startup
```bash
# Start the server
python3 main.py

# In another terminal, test health
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}'
```

### Test Authentication
```bash
# Test authentication endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "authenticate_user",
      "arguments": {
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "password": "testpassword"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Environment Validation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate_env.sh
echo "=== Phase 1 Environment Validation ==="

# Check required environment variables
required_vars=("CONVEX_URL" "MCP_SERVER_HOST" "MCP_SERVER_PORT" "JWT_SECRET" "MCP_API_TOKEN")
for var in "${required_vars[@]}"; do
    if [[ -z "${!var}" ]]; then
        echo "❌ Missing required variable: $var"
        exit 1
    else
        echo "✅ $var is set"
    fi
done

# Check port availability
if lsof -i :3001 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "❌ Port 3001 is in use"
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ Port 3001 is available"
fi

echo "✅ All environment checks passed!"
```

## 🚀 Phase 1 Completion Criteria

Phase 1 is **complete** when:
1. ✅ All verification checklist items are checked
2. ✅ Server starts successfully and responds to HTTP requests
3. ✅ Authentication with Convex backend works reliably
4. ✅ Environment configuration is production-ready
5. ✅ Security measures are properly implemented
6. ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
