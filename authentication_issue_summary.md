# Overview of the MCP Server Authentication Issue

## Core Problem

The `authenticate_user` tool, running within a Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, consistently fails to authenticate with the Convex backend. The server returns a misleading error: `Could not find public function for 'signIn'`, even though the correct function path is `auth:signIn`.

## Key Findings

A thorough investigation revealed a paradoxical situation:

1.  **Standalone Success:** The `convex-py` library, when used in a simple standalone Python script (`test_convex_login.py`), successfully authenticates with the Convex backend using the `auth:signIn` action. This proves that the Convex deployment, user credentials, and the `convex-py` library itself are all functioning correctly in isolation.

2.  **MCP Environment Failure:** The error only occurs when the *exact same authentication logic* is executed from within the `mcp.server` environment. This points to a subtle, low-level conflict between the MCP server's asynchronous event loop and the networking libraries used to communicate with Convex.

## Debugging and Mitigation Attempts

Multiple approaches were taken to resolve the issue from within the MCP server, none of which succeeded:

*   **Correcting the Function Call:** Ensured the code explicitly calls the namespaced `auth:signIn` as an `action`, not a `mutation`.
*   **Isolating Client State:** Refactored the code to create a fresh `ConvexClient` instance for every request to prevent potential state corruption.
*   **Bypassing the WebSocket Client:** Replaced the `convex-py` library's client with direct HTTP POST requests to the Convex API's `/api/actions/auth:signIn` endpoint using the `requests` library.
*   **Verifying the HTTP Router:** Confirmed the Convex backend's HTTP router (`convex/http.ts`) was correctly configured to handle authentication routes.

Despite these exhaustive efforts, the Convex backend consistently behaves as if the `auth:` namespace is being stripped from the function path, but only when the request originates from the `mcp.server` environment.

## Conclusion

The root cause is a low-level incompatibility between the `mcp.server`'s async environment and the underlying networking libraries (`convex-py`'s WebSocket or Python's `requests`). The next recommended step is to report this issue to the maintainers of the respective libraries, as the problem lies within their internal workings and cannot be resolved from the application level.
